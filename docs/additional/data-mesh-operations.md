# Data Mesh Operations Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the operational procedures and best practices for managing the data mesh architecture in production.

## Operational Architecture

### 1. Deployment Strategy

#### Infrastructure Deployment
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Environment management
- Configuration management

#### Deployment Patterns
```yaml
# Example Deployment Configuration
Resources:
  DataMeshDeployment:
    Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack
    Properties:
      TemplateURL: !Sub 'https://${S3Bucket}.s3.amazonaws.com/data-mesh-template.yaml'
      Parameters:
        Environment: !Ref Environment
        DataDomain: !Ref DataDomain
        Scale: !Ref Scale
```

### 2. Monitoring and Alerting

#### Monitoring Stack
- CloudWatch metrics
- Custom dashboards
- Log aggregation
- Performance monitoring

#### Alert Configuration
```yaml
# Example Alert Configuration
Resources:
  PerformanceAlert:
    Type: AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm
    Properties:
      AlarmName: HighLatencyAlert
      MetricName: Latency
      Namespace: DataMesh/Performance
      Statistic: Average
      Period: 300
      EvaluationPeriods: 2
      Threshold: 1000
      AlarmActions:
        - !Ref OperationsTeamSNSTopic
```

### 3. Incident Management

#### Incident Response
1. Detection
2. Classification
3. Response
4. Resolution
