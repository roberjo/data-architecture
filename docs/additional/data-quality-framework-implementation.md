# Data Quality Framework Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing a robust data quality framework within our data architecture. The framework is designed to ensure data accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability across all data assets.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Quality Dimensions

#### Completeness
- **Definition**: Measures the presence of required data elements
- **Implementation**:
  - Null value checks
  - Required field validation
  - Data coverage analysis
- **Tools**: Great Expectations, dbt tests, custom SQL validations

#### Accuracy
- **Definition**: Verifies data correctness against source systems
- **Implementation**:
  - Cross-system reconciliation
  - Business rule validation
  - Statistical accuracy checks
- **Tools**: Great Expectations, custom validation scripts

#### Consistency
- **Definition**: Ensures uniform data representation
- **Implementation**:
  - Format standardization
  - Data type validation
  - Cross-table consistency checks
- **Tools**: dbt tests, schema validation tools

#### Timeliness
- **Definition**: Measures data freshness and update frequency
- **Implementation**:
  - Data pipeline monitoring
  - SLA tracking
  - Update frequency validation
- **Tools**: Airflow monitoring, custom timestamps

### 2. Implementation Layers
